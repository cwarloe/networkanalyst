| Requirement | Example Explanation |
|---|---|
| Identify key fields in each layer | **Ethernet:** Source MAC: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`, Destination MAC: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`, EtherType: `0x0800`<br>**IP:** Source IP: `192.168.1.1`, Destination IP: `10.0.0.1`, TTL: `64`, Protocol: `TCP`<br>**TCP:** Source Port: `80`, Destination Port: `443`, Sequence Number: `123456789`, Acknowledgment Number: `987654321`, Flags: `SYN`<br>**UDP:** Source Port: `53`, Destination Port: `53`, Length: `100` |
| Explain the importance of IP addresses and ports in netflow analysis | IP addresses identify the source and destination of network traffic, allowing for the tracking of communication patterns and relationships between devices. Ports are crucial for identifying the type of service or application in use, enabling the analysis of traffic types and detecting anomalies or malicious activities based on expected port usage. |
| Describe ARP spoofing, SSL stripping, and their implications | **ARP Spoofing:** Involves sending falsified ARP messages on a network to associate a malicious MAC address with a legitimate IP address. This can result in traffic interception or redirection.<br>**SSL Stripping:** Downgrades HTTPS connections to HTTP, making encrypted communications vulnerable to interception and manipulation. This indicates potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. |
| Explain SYN packets without ACK and their significance | SYN packets without ACK indicate that a connection initiation attempt has been made but has not yet been acknowledged. This could be an initial connection attempt or a port scanning activity, where multiple SYN packets are sent to various ports to identify open services and potential vulnerabilities. |
| Discuss SMB protocol's role and its exploitation | The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol facilitates file and printer sharing in Windows environments. Attackers can exploit SMB for lateral movement by accessing and manipulating shared resources across the network. Port 445 is commonly associated with SMB traffic and is a key target for attackers. |
| Explain SMB share names and administrative shares | SMB share names are used to identify shared resources on a network. Administrative shares, such as `C$`, provide remote access to system drives and are often targeted in attacks for privilege escalation and unauthorized access. Mounted shares can be leveraged to move laterally within a network. |
| Describe FTP data transfers and HTTP POST for data exfiltration | FTP (File Transfer Protocol) can be used to transfer large amounts of data, making it a potential vector for data exfiltration. HTTP POST requests, which send data to a server, can also be used to upload data covertly. Indicators of data exfiltration include unusual traffic volumes or patterns. |
| Explain common backdoor ports and beacon messages | Common backdoor ports like `4444` are used by malware to establish persistent connections to an attacker’s server. Beacon messages are periodic signals sent by malware to indicate it is still active, and persistent connections suggest ongoing compromise. |
| Discuss DNS usage and spoofing | DNS (Domain Name System) resolves domain names to IP addresses, facilitating access to websites and services. DNS spoofing involves redirecting DNS queries to malicious IP addresses, potentially leading to phishing attacks or redirection of traffic to compromised sites. |
| Explain significance of high port numbers and unusual open ports | Ports above `49151` are dynamic or private ports used by applications for temporary connections. Unusual open ports can indicate the presence of unauthorized services or malware. Correlating open ports with known services helps identify and mitigate security threats. |
| Describe VLANs, their tags, and significance | Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) segment network traffic to improve security and performance. VLAN tags in packet headers identify the VLAN to which a packet belongs. Understanding VLANs helps analyze traffic patterns and detect potential issues or misconfigurations in network segmentation. |
| Explain VLAN tag structure and interpretation | VLAN tags are inserted into Ethernet frames to indicate the VLAN ID, which is a number that identifies the VLAN. Interpreting VLAN IDs involves analyzing these tags to understand which VLAN traffic belongs to and how it affects network segmentation and security. |
| Discuss common proxy ports and their security implications | Common proxy ports like `8080` are used to route traffic through proxies, which can anonymize user activity. Identifying HTTP requests going through proxies can help detect evasive behavior. Proxies can both protect privacy and be used for malicious purposes, making their monitoring essential for security. |
| Describe encapsulation protocols and identification in packet captures | Encapsulation protocols like PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control), and CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) are used to encapsulate data for transmission over networks. Identifying these protocols in packet captures involves analyzing protocol headers and frames to understand data transmission methods. |
| Explain the role of TTL in IP packets and its use | TTL (Time-to-Live) in IP packets determines the packet’s lifespan and helps prevent routing loops. Lower TTL values can indicate the packet's proximity to its source or destination. TTL values can be used to estimate network distance and troubleshoot routing issues. |
| Discuss "application/octet-stream" content type and "MZ" header | The "application/octet-stream" content type indicates binary data, which could be a file or executable. The "MZ" header is a signature found at the beginning of Windows executable files. Identifying these indicators helps in extracting and analyzing potentially suspicious files from network traffic. |
