### Explanations:
- **ARP Spoofing**: Filters ARP replies to detect potential ARP spoofing based on the source and destination IP addresses.
- **SSL Stripping**: Filters out HTTP traffic not using HTTPS to detect potential SSL stripping.
- **Port Scanning**: Captures SYN packets to detect scanning of open ports.
- **SMB Traffic**: Filters SMB traffic to detect lateral movement or access to mounted shares.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Captures FTP or HTTP POST requests with large amounts of data to detect data exfiltration.
- **Persistence**: Filters traffic to port 4444, a common port used by malware for persistence.
- **DNS Spoofing**: Checks if the resolved DNS address is different from what is expected to detect DNS spoofing.
- **Open Ports**: Captures traffic to high-numbered ports to identify anomalous open ports.
- **VLAN and Proxy**: Filters VLAN-tagged packets and traffic on port 8080 for proxies.
- **Encapsulation Types**: Filters for different encapsulation types (PPP, HDLC) and raw CHAP packets.
- **Traffic Location**: Filters packets with low TTL values to identify local or misrouted traffic.
- **Suspicious Files**: Identifies HTTP responses with binary content that might indicate file transfers or suspicious files.
